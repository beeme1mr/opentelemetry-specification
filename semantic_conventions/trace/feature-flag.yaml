      This semantic convention defines the attributes used to represent a
      feature flag evaluation as a span.
    span_kind: internal
    attributes:
      - id: flag_key
        type: string
        required: always
        brief: The unique identifier of the feature flag.
        examples: ["show-new-logo"]
  - id: feature_flag.provider
    prefix: feature_flag.provider
    extends: feature_flag
    brief: Semantic convention for the provider performing the flag evaluation.
    attributes:
      - id: name
        type: string
        required: always
        brief: The name of the provider performing the flag evaluation.
        examples: ["Flag Manager"]
      - id: management_url
        type: string
        brief: The URL used to manage the feature flag in the provider.
        examples: ["http://localhost:4200/flags/1"]
  - id: feature_flag.evaluated
    prefix: feature_flag.evaluated
    extends: feature_flag
    brief: Semantic convection for the values evaluated by provider.
    attributes:
      - id: variant
        type: string
        brief: The name associated with the evaluated value.
        examples: ["reverse"]
        required:
          conditional: >
            A variant should be used if it is available. If the variant is
            present, feature_flag.evaluated.value should be omitted.
      - id: value
        type: string
        brief: A string representation of the evaluated value.
        examples: ["true", "red", "on"]

          conditional: >
            The value should only be used if the variant is not available. How
            the value is represented as a string should be determined by the
            implementer.
